Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:

    Arithmetic Operators
        Operator 	Description
        + 	        Addition
        - 	        Subtraction
        * 	        Multiplication
        ** 	        Exponentiation (ES2016)
        / 	        Division
        % 	        Modulus (Division Remainder)
        ++ 	        Increment
        -- 	        Decrement
    Assignment Operators
        Operator 	Example 	Same As
        = 	        x = y 	    x = y
        += 	        x += y  	x = x + y
        -= 	        x -= y 	    x = x - y
        *= 	        x *= y 	    x = x * y
        /= 	        x /= y 	    x = x / y
        %= 	        x %= y 	    x = x % y
        **= 	    x **= y 	x = x ** y
    Comparison Operators
        Operator 	Description
        == 	        equal to        (1 == '1')
        === 	    equal value and equal type (1 === '1')
        != 	        not equal   (1 != '1')
        !== 	    not equal value and not equal type   (1 !== '1')
        > 	        greater than
        < 	        less than
        >= 	        greater than or equal to
        <= 	        less than or equal to
        ? 	        ternary operator
    Logical Operators
    Ternary Operators
